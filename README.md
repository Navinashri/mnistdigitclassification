Project title: MNIST Digit Classification with Neural Network

It is a image recognition project and belongs to deep learning domain. The dataset was collected from Keras. Image processing is done from the dataset and they are split. The resultant is fed into a neural network and trained. It is used to identify the digits(0-9).
