Project title: MNIST Digit Classification with Neural Network

It is a image recognition project and belongs to deep learning domain. The dataset was collected from Keras. Image processing is done from the dataset and they are split. The resultant is fed into a neural network and trained. It is used to identify the digits(0-9).

Neural Network: A neural network is a series of algorithms that endeavors to recognize underlying relationships in a set of data through a process that mimics the way the human brain operates. In this sense, neural networks refer to systems of neurons, either organic or artificial in nature.Neural networks can adapt to changing input; so the network generates the best possible result without needing to redesign the output criteria. The concept of neural networks, which has its roots in artificial intelligence, is swiftly gaining popularity in the development of trading systems.

1.Neural networks are a series of algorithms that mimic the operations of an animal brain to recognize relationships between vast amounts of data.

2.As such, they tend to resemble the connections of neurons and synapses found in the brain.

3.They are used in a variety of applications in financial services, from forecasting and marketing research to fraud detection and risk assessment.

4.Neural networks with several process layers are known as "deep" networks and are used for deep learning algorithms.

5.The success of neural networks for stock market price prediction varies.
